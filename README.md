# React Coding Challenge

## Create a React App that contains a header, body, and footer, all represented by different components called "Header", "Body", and "Footer".

## In the body of the app, present the user with a button, that when clicked, fetches 2 sets of data from a Public GraphQL endpoint and displays each result set in a grid view within the Body component.

## Display the total record count form the GraphQL queries in the header component as a status.

## Create a form in the body component that asks the user to input their name. When the user inputs their name, display the name in the header component.

Bonus: Use styles from this Storybook.js gallery to improve the look and feel of the app. https://5ccbc373887ca40020446347-gazlgmdsbi.chromatic.com/
